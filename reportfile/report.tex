\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{BACKGROUND}

The field of web development has rapidly evolved over the past few decades, becoming one of the most dynamic and essential domains in computer science and information technology. The internet, once a medium for static information display, has transformed into a highly interactive platform enabling businesses, educational institutions, and individuals to connect globally.

In the early stages of web design, developers primarily relied on simple \textbf{HTML (HyperText Markup Language)} to create basic webpages. As the need for visual appeal and structure grew, \textbf{CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)} was introduced, allowing developers to separate content from design and apply consistent styling across webpages. Over time, the demand for interactivity gave rise to \textbf{JavaScript}, which added dynamic features such as form validation, animations, and responsive user interfaces.

Today, web development encompasses a wide variety of technologies and frameworks designed to enhance both performance and user experience. However, understanding the fundamental building blocks—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—remains crucial for every aspiring web developer. Mastery of these core technologies lays the foundation for advanced front-end and full-stack development. 

This training program was designed with beginners in mind, focusing on practical, hands-on exposure to these core technologies.

\chapter*{APPENDIX}

\section*{A. Source Code}

The following C++ program represents the core functionality and logic design of the calculator project developed as part of this semester’s coursework. The focus is on computational efficiency and clean modular structure.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C++, caption={Main Calculator Code}]
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
#include <chrono>
using namespace std;
using namespace std::chrono;

int main() {
    cout << "Scientific Calculator\n";
    double a, b;
    char op;
    cout << "Enter expression (e.g., 3 + 4): ";
    cin >> a >> op >> b;

    switch(op) {
        case '+': cout << "Result: " << a + b; break;
        case '-': cout << "Result: " << a - b; break;
        case '*': cout << "Result: " << a * b; break;
        case '/':
            if (b != 0)
                cout << "Result: " << a / b;
            else
                cout << "Error: Division by zero";
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Invalid Operator";
    }

    return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The calculator integrates both basic and advanced functionalities, providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Basic Function Panel:} Digits (0--9), arithmetic operations, clear, and backspace.
    \item \textbf{Scientific Function Panel:} Trigonometric (\textit{sin}, \textit{cos}, \textit{tan}), logarithmic, and exponential functions.
    \item \textbf{Result Display:} Displays evaluated results dynamically.
\end{itemize}

\section*{B. Experimental Results}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case} & \textbf{Input Expression} & \textbf{Expected Output} & \textbf{Observed Output} & \textbf{Remarks} \\ \hline
1 & 3 + 5 & 8 & 8 & Correct \\ \hline
2 & 7 / 0 & Error & Error & Correct error handling \\ \hline
3 & sin(90) & 1 & 1 & Verified \\ \hline
4 & log(1) & 0 & 0 & Correct \\ \hline
5 & exp(1) & 2.718 & 2.718 & Accurate \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Experimental Results of Calculator Functions}

\section*{C. Execution Time Analysis}

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Input Size} & \textbf{Operation Type} & \textbf{Time Taken ($\mu$s)} \\ \hline
Small (5 ops) & Basic arithmetic & 18 \\ \hline
Medium (20 ops) & Trigonometric & 64 \\ \hline
Large (100 ops) & Mixed operations & 205 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Execution Time Analysis of Calculator Operations}
\end{table}

The observed time complexity shows near-linear growth with increased input size, confirming the efficiency of the program design.
