# JavaScript Setup and Fundamentals

## What Was Done

- Installed and configured **Node.js** on Windows 11 for local JavaScript execution.
- Ran the basic `console.log("Hello World");` script using the terminal.
- Learned the difference between **`console`** (Node/Terminal) and **`document`** (Browser/DOM).
- Understood the use of **`var`**, **`let`**, and **`const`** for declaring variables.

## Highlights

- `console.log()` outputs to terminal (Node.js).
- `document` is only accessible in browser environments (e.g., `document.getElementById()`).
- `var` is function-scoped; `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
- `const` variables cannot be reassigned.
