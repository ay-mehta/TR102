# Transport Services Cards Layout

## What Was Done

- Designed a **card-based layout** to showcase different freight service types: ocean, air, and street.
- Used **Flexbox** to distribute three cards evenly inside a central container.
- Incorporated **Font Awesome icons** (`fa-ship`, `fa-plane`, `fa-truck`) with a floating badge-like effect.
- Practiced use of **absolute and relative positioning** to overlay icons on images.
- Styled buttons with hover effects to improve interactivity and user experience.
- Ensured semantic structure with clear content blocks (`img`, `h1`, `p`, `button`) in each card.
- Applied visual polish using `border-radius`, padding, and consistent typography.
