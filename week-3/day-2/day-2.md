# Image Hover Reveal Effect

## What Was Done

- Built an interactive **image hover effect** using HTML and CSS.
- Positioned text absolutely over an image and made it **appear on hover** using sibling selectors (`img:hover ~ .text`).
- Applied **smooth transitions** using `opacity` and `transition` properties for fade-in animation.
- Styled the message with **custom fonts and strong emphasis**, highlighting "Special Forces" using a distinct color and font.

## Highlights

- Used **Flexbox** inside the container for perfect center alignment of both image and text.
- Hovering over the image reveals a **motivational tagline** with dynamic styling.
- Ensured responsive structure using `vh` units for height and centralized alignment with `margin: auto`.
- Clean, modern design with semantic HTML and scoped styling.
