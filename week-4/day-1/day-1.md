# JavaScript Strings and Methods

## What Was Done

- Learned different ways to define strings using `"double"`, `'single'`, and \`backtick\` quotes.
- Explored string interpolation and embedded quotes inside strings.
- Practiced using string methods:
  - `.length`
  - `.at()`
  - `.charAt()`
  - `.slice()`
  - `.substring()`
  - `.split()`
  - `.trimStart()`
  - `.replace()`

## Highlights

- Used backticks (\``\`) to include both single and double quotes easily.
- Observed how `.at()` and `.charAt()` access characters.
- Demonstrated slicing and substring extraction:
  - `.slice(start, end)` includes `start` but excludes `end`.
  - `.substring(start, end)` swaps if `start > end`.
- Used `.split(" ")` to convert a string to an array.
- Used `.trimStart()` to remove leading spaces.
- Capitalized first letter of a string:
