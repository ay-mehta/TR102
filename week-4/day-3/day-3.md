## What Was Done

- Learned about object literals and how to define methods within them.
- Practiced using this keyword inside object and class methods.
- Created multiple classes using ES6 class syntax.
- Instantiated objects using the new keyword.
- Explored method definitions inside classes and invoked them on different objects.

## Highlights

- **Object Literals**:
  - Defined a simple object and accessed its methods using dot notation.

- **Classes and Constructors**:
  - Defined a class using a constructor (new) with different properties.

- **Using `this`**:
  - Defined class whose methods use `this`.

- **Multiple Instances of Class**:
  - Created more than one instance of a class with distinct arguments.
