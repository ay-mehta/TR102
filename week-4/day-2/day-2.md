# JavaScript: Arrays, Conditionals, and String-Array Conversion

## What Was Done

- Split a string into an array of characters using `.split("")`.
- Used `if-else` to check voting eligibility.
- Learned how `.sort()` behaves lexicographically (not numerically).
- Converted arrays to strings using `.toString()`.
- Used `.split(delimiter)` to break strings.
- Used `.slice(start, end)` to extract a portion of an array.
- Used `.splice(start, deleteCount)` to remove elements from an array.
- Reversed a string by chaining `.split()`, `.reverse()`, and `.join()`.
