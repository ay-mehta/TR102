# HTML Nested Lists Practice

## What Was Done

- Practiced creating **ordered** and **unordered lists** using semantic HTML.
- Explored different list types including:
  - Roman numerals (`<ol type="i">`)
  - Alphabetical (`<ol type="a">`)
  - Circular bullets (`<ul type="circle">`)
  - Square bullets (`<ul type="square">`)
  - Disc bullets (`<ul type="disc">`)
- Nested lists up to **four levels deep** to understand structure and hierarchy.
- Ensured proper indentation and closing of HTML tags to maintain valid markup.
- Improved understanding of how nested lists render visually in browsers.

## Task: Complex List Structure

- Created a structured list titled **"List Example"**.
- Used `<ol>` and `<ul>` elements to create a visually layered and logically grouped set of items.
- Combined various list styles within nested levels for clarity and demonstration.
- Ensured list items at all depths are properly readable and visually distinct.
