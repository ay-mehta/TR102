# Vegefoods Clone â€“ Responsive Navigation and Hero Section

## What Was Done

- Created a **responsive landing page** for a fictional organic store called *Vegefoods*.
- Implemented a **sticky navigation bar** with logo, menu items, and responsive hamburger toggle for smaller screens.
- Styled banner section containing **contact, email, and assurance messages** using Flexbox.
- Used **media queries** to change layout and visibility across screen widths.
- Designed a **hero container with background slideshow animation** using `@keyframes`.
- Employed Google Fonts (`Shadows Into Light`) for elegant heading typography.
- Added **interactive buttons** with hover transitions for improved user experience.
- Incorporated Font Awesome icons (`fa-phone`, `fa-paper-plane`, `fa-cart-shopping`, `fa-bars`) for visual clarity and modern UI.

## Highlights

- Navigation adapts based on screen size (e.g., hides menu and shows hamburger menu below 930px).
- Dynamic background cycling between `vegetable-basket.webp` and `fruits-and-vegetables.webp`.
- `View Details` button styled with transitions and soft-rounded edges.
- Content aligns properly across mobile and desktop using consistent Flexbox layout and spacing.
