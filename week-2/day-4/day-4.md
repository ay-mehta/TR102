# Vegefoods Header and Navigation Clone

## What Was Done

- Recreated the **header and navigation** section of a fictional grocery site inspired by "Vegefoods".

  - Hid or showed menu elements conditionally.
  - Changed background color for nav in mobile view.
- Incorporated **Font Awesome icons** for phone, mail, cart, and menu.
