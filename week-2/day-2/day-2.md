# Flexbox and Responsive Layout Practice

## What Was Done

- Implemented `flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-wrap` for layout control.
- Used **media queries** to make layouts adapt to various screen sizes.
- Practiced **semantic HTML structure** and ensured proper element nesting.
- Styled form inputs (`input[type=email]`, `input[type=submit]`) with hover transitions.
- Ensured accessibility and professionalism by using appropriate `alt` text and naming conventions for image files.
